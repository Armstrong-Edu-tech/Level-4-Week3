# Section 3 – Custom Modules in Node.js

This section focuses on creating, exporting, and importing custom modules in Node.js. You will learn how to organize code into reusable modules, export functions and objects, and import them in other files using `require()` and `module.exports`.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js and npm installed.

**Install dependencies:** Run `npm install` inside each subfolder.

**Run scripts:** From each subfolder, use `node <filename>.js` (e.g., `node calc.js` or `node main.js` or `node app.js`).

## Folders

### 3.1 – Creating Custom Modules
Defining functions in a separate file and exporting them using `module.exports` in various ways (object export, direct export, exports shorthand).

### 3.2 – Importing and Working with Custom Modules
Using `require()` to import custom modules and call exported functions, including both full object import and destructuring import methods.

### 3.3 – Practical Activity: Building a Simple Custom Module
Creating a custom module for square calculations (area and perimeter) and using it in a main application script.
